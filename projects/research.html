    <h2>Background Research</h2>
    <p> My original idea for the final project on the topic of “diversity” was to compile poetry from poets of color and create an interactive interpretation of each poem I received. I wasn’t satisfied with this idea because I was a) concerned with co-opting
      others’ narratives for my personal benefit, b) worried that my interpretations of their poetry would be problematic or not true to their vision, and c) not entirely convinced that my project would have an impact beyond awareness of different stories.
      </p>

    <p>I’ve been writing an article for InPrint about design and social justice, and a theme I kept going back to was how to understanding one’s own identity is vital when it comes to getting involved in social issues as a designer. I’ve worked at the Cross
      Cultural Center as their graphic designer for the past two years, and in my time there, I’ve been immersed in several workshops and activities that have contributed to my personal knowledge on social issues and activism. After reflecting on this,
      my new idea is to incorporate some common activities or facilitation methods that aim to <strong>push individuals to understand their own privileges, intersections of different identities, and become compassionate towards others with different struggles.</strong>      Pushing people to understand themselves in a political, sociological context is necessary in order to <strong> design for and with marginalized communities </strong>.</p>

    <p>I also didn’t want to abandon my initial idea of sharing narratives completely, so another aspect of the project would be to incorporate diverse narratives through various forms of art, not limited to poetry. This would explore how art and design
      can be very inaccessible for marginalized communities, but also showcase how that hasn’t stopped creative individuals from these communities from making art. I also want to highlight how less mainstream art can provide a counternarrative, and indeed,
      resistance to the oppressive systems we live under. </p>

    <p>When researching about different social justice facilitation activities, I found a website called Social Justice Toolbox, an online facilitation resource for social justice organizers. One of the activities I found outlined in an article there is
      called “Identity Signs” (it also has different names depending on the facilitator). The activity calls for the facilitator to hang up different identity signs on the wall. Then, they read statements that ask participants to think about their own
      identities, others’ perceptions of their identities, and their personal experiences with their identities. Participants move to different signs based on the statements, and in some cases, have the chance to share why they chose that identity for
      that particular statement. </p>

    <p>One article I read that is very helpful for understanding design through a social justice lens is “10 Ways Designers Can Support Social Justice” by Design Justice Network. The ten suggestions in the article are:
      <ol>
        <li>“Define a set of principles by which you will work.”</li>
       <li>“Distance yourself from those who work against your principles.”</li>
       <li>“Rethink representation.”</li>
       <li>“Consider your negative impact.”</li>
       <li>“Get involved and build on work that is already happening.”</li>
       <li>“Humble yourself. Design with, not for.”</li>
       <li>“Learn about concepts of privilege and anti-oppression.”</li>
       <li>“Know when not to design.”</li>
       <li>“Shape alternative futures.”</li>
       <li>“Begin by listening.”</li>
       </ol>
       The article holds radical, thoughtful ideas about how to be analytical of oneself and purposeful in one’s intentions
      when designing for social justice. It encourages designers to think about the larger systems in place and how we can use our power to combat injustices.

    <p>The last article, “Two Designers Built a Website to Combat the Lack of Diversity in Creative Fields” is about a project called “People of Craft” by Timothy Goodman and Amélie Lamont that is a directory of creative work by people of color. Lamont says,
      “people of color also have the capacity to be multidimensional creatives worthy of the same attention their white peers receive, [without] relegating them only to a checkbox of ethnicity,” which is also the aim of my project. As described in the
      article, Lamont is black, Jamaican-American, while Goodman is white; the project is a good example of how two people from different backgrounds with different privileges can advocate for the same issues in a way that doesn’t put them at the forefront
      but rather those they are serving. </p>
